	NOTICE: All digital assets and ideas contained herein, and made possible by the "Sorcery Mod", is

	irrefutably and solely, extended and granted to The Fun Pimps legal entity in good faith.

	USAGE: The Sorcery Mod may be downloaded and used by players of the 7 Days to Die community, 
	with no required royalties. Other than the XML Code itself, digital assets and works of the Sorcery Mod 
	may not be used outside of the Sorcery Mod. By downloading and using the Sorcery Mod, users of the 
	mod understand and accept full and sole responsibility and liability of using the mod. Author, nor The 
	Fun Pimps, shall be held responsible or liable for any possible conflict(s) as a direct or indirect result 
	of using this mod.

	REDISTRIBUTION: The XML code of the Sorcery Mod may solely be redistributed within the 7 Days 
	to Die community. Conditions of redistribution require this notice to remain in full, unmodified, and a 
	direct link, with credit stated, to the original Mod and Author. You may not redistribute the digital 
	Assets or works, aside from XML Code, of the Sorcery Mod. The Sorcery Mod itself should not be 
	redistributed outside of its original distribution channels.

	PROHIBITED USE: Users are not permitted to modify, or bypass, Supporter Exclusive perks or items in any way.
	The free in-game "Supporter Key Item" can be obtained through normal game means (loot, trader) and will unlock all 
	supporter exclusive perks and items. Modifying or bypassing Supporter Exclusive perks or items is a violation of the 
	Sorcery Terms of Use.

	CREDIT: This mod is made possible through the framework provided by The Fun Pimps. It is their 
	hard work and ongoing dedication to building and improving an awesome game that fuels the passion 
	and drives the creation of this mod. Supporters of the Sorcery Mod make ongoing development 
	possible. Without their support, it is not possible to put in the enormous amount of time required to 
	create the plethora of unique assets that make Sorcery.

	MODIFICATION: The Terms of Use and Disclaimer herein are subject to changes and modifications.

	DISCLAIMER
	_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
	Sorcery is and will always be 100% FREE. When you choose to Support Development, you are supporting the
	unique individual work I personally do outside of the game: The creation of unique VFX, SFX, Art, Time creating
	content and the services/interaction I provide here on Discord. You are not supporting "derivative work of 
	7 Days to Die" (AKA modding code/changing skins/etc). That is against TFP policy.

	Support Not Required: Those unwilling, or unable, to support development can obtain in-game items 100% FREE.
	You are not required to support in order to obtain in-game items. Non-supporters are able to obtain any
	"In-Game Supporter Exclusives" 100% FREE, without supporting development. However, I cannot continue development
	of Sorcery at this level without Ongoing Support. If support drops below a threshold, development halts. The large
	amount of time allotted to development is made possible through the generous support given by our Supporters.
	Disclaimer subject to ongoing changes.
